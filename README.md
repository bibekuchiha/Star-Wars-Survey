# Guided Project: Star Wars Survey

In this project, We'll be working with Jupyter notebook and analyzing data on the Star Wars movies.

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?
For this project, we'll be cleaning and exploring the data set in Jupyter notebook.

The data has several columns, including:

* RespondentID - An anonymized ID for the respondent (person taking the survey)
* Gender - The respondent's gender
* Age - The respondent's age
* Household Income - The respondent's income
* Education - The respondent's education level
* Location (Census Region) - The respondent's location
* Have you seen any of the 6 films in the Star Wars franchise? - Has a Yes or No response
* Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise? - Has a Yes or No response

There are several other columns containing answers to questions about the Star Wars movies. For some questions, the respondent had to check one or more boxes. This type of data is difficult to represent in columnar format. As a result, this data set needs a lot of cleaning.
